####Pulling "dummy" data from this [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u54y6qETcyBdpQM1dJblD_F3TSeZ_qD7RPs5Ne2fPzk/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true "Input Sheet") | [Output](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u54y6qETcyBdpQM1dJblD_F3TSeZ_qD7RPs5Ne2fPzk/pubhtml?gid=1128971629&single=true "Output Sheet")

##Description and Scope of Independent Study:
Create a Bioinformatic(Genomic?)/data, processing/analytics platform to process/compute data stored in Google Cloud Applications and output to Web-based interactive front end.  
##Methods and Materials to be Used:
Python/R for data processing/analysis and HTML, CSS, JavaScript/Jquery for Web Front End. Genomic/ELISA/*other* derived datasets. 
##Form of Completed Work:
“Full Stack” system that allows for users with minimal to no knowledge of programming to: import/convert large raw datasets, perform complex computations and useful analysis, share and visualize the data, easily implement their own specialized computational functions. Well documented code and GitHub repository explaining the implementation of methods. Accompanying documentation exploring/explaining “real world” approaches to similar computational biology problems.     
##Progress Report Schedule:
Weekly(bi-weekly) meeting with Faculty advisors to demonstrate progress, refine function. Well documented GitHub repository. Screen captured videos demonstrating/explaining platform functions to supplement face to face meetings.
